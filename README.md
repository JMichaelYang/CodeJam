# How To Use

1. Ensure that the filepaths in the utilities.FileHandler class are accurate for your system. 

2. Create a copy of the Template class in an appropriate package (ie: "qualification") with an appropriate name (ie: "Counting Sheep").

3. Replace any references to the Template class with references to the new copy.

4. Ensure that the file names in the Read and Write functions match the input file name and the intended output file name.

5. Write the code to manipulate the inputs in the manipulate() function of the new class.

6. Run the main() function of the new class.

7. Find the output file wherever your output path (established in FileHander) points to with the name set in step 4.
